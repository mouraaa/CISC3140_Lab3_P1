The .rtf file is a list of items one might sell if they were hosting a technology based website. Each row consists of the item name, the price as well as how many  of that specific item is in inventory. The .awk file reads and adds up each item's final price and multiplies it by the available. It then outputs the total amount of money that will be made if everything is sold.

### Where's the .csv file?
I am using a macbook and apple products do not come with native programs using .csv files. However, the .rtf file is being treated as a csv file since a csv file is just a comma separated file and everything in the .rtf file is comma separated. If you are working on a windows device, you can copy and paste the data in the 'data.rtf' file without the header information and the program will work just fine.

### Dependencies
Must have bash downloaded.

### Using the script:
Simply type in your terminal the following: 
`sh program.awk`
